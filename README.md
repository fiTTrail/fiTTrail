# fiTTrail
## Motivating patients to exercise with the support of their GP and the community.

fiTTrail provides a way for a GP to refer patients to take part in a tailored exercise programme. Patients upload evidence of their progress in the form of photos and geo-trails, and are linked with other participants in their area. By being able to compare themselves with their peers, participants have a social incentive to persevere, while GPs are able to message participants through the app and review progress at subsequent consultations.

Our premise and experience is that Health Promotion is failing, unless there is an effective support structure in place.

fiTTrail solves this problem in three ways:â€”

1) Measurement - Currently there is no way a doctor can track the patient's level of physical activity that he/she has prescribed. fiTTrail encourages patients to upload their activities on a regular basis

2) Accountability - People fail in lifestyle changes due to lack of accountability/coaching. fiTTrail enables health professionals to send automated messages if a patient fails to do exercise, or if they have done and so can be congratulated.

3) Social proof - we live in a very individualised society. Behavioural psychology teaches us that people belonging to a team/group are more likely to commit to sustained lifestyle changes. fiTTrail enrols people in a group and allows them to view their own performance compared to a group.

fiTTrail is the crucial component in a health promotion strategy.
