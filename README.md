# fiTTrail
## Motivating patients to exercise with the support of their GP and the community.

fiTTrail provides a way for a GP to refer patients to take part in a tailored exercise programme. Patients upload evidence of their progress in the form of photos and geo-trails, and are linked with other participants in their area. By being able to compare themselves with their peers, participants have a social incentive to persevere, while GPs are able to message participants through the app and review progress at subsequent consultations.
